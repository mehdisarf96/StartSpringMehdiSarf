add more than one object of the same type to the Spring Context
and individually refer to these objects.

You can add more beans of the same type to the Spring context
by using multiple methods annotated with @Bean.

Each instance will have a unique identifier.
To refer to them afterward, you’ll need to use the beans’ identifiers.
