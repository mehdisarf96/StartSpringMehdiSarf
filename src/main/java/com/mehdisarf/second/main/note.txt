add more than one object of the same type to the Spring Context
and individually refer to these objects.

You can add more beans of the same type to the Spring context
by using multiple methods annotated with @Bean.

Each instance will have a unique identifier.
To refer to them afterward, you’ll need to use the beans’ identifiers.

-----------------------
When you have multiple beans of the same kind in the Spring context
you can make one of them primary. @Primary

A primary bean is the one Spring will choose if it has multiple options
and you don’t specify a name; the primary bean is simply Spring’s default choice
