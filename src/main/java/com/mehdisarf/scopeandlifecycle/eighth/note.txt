Don’t make the mistake of injecting the
CommentProcessor
directly in the
CommentService
bean.

The CommentService bean is a singleton,
which means that Spring creates only an instance of this class

As a consequence, Spring will also inject the
dependencies of this class just once when it creates the CommentService bean itself. In
this case, you’ll end up with only an instance of the CommentProcessor. Each call of the
sendComment() method will use this unique instance, so with multiple threads you’ll run
into the same race condition issues as with a singleton bean.
