If you run this application as-is, you’ll get an exception because Spring doesn’t know which
of the two beans in its context to choose for injection.

NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException:

No qualifying bean of type 'com.mehdisarf.scenario...proxies.CommentNotificationProxy' available:
expected single matching bean but found 2:
commentPushNotificationProxy, emailCommentNotificationProxy.
