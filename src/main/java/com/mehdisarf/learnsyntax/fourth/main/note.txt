Programmatically adding beans to the Spring context

it enables you to add new instances in the context directly by
calling a method of the context instance.

Using the registerBean() method to add specific object instances to the Spring context.

you just need to call the registerBean() method of the ApplicationContext instance.


this project’s configuration class is empty, and the Parrot class we use
for our bean definition example is just a plain old Java object (POJO);
we use no annotation with it.

instance of type Parrot to the Spring context
